# Creating Custom Community Reports

**Location: <Icon symbol="report" /> Report Builder**

After exploring regional trends, hotspots, and more through the COVID Atlas, you might want to share insights from this tool to your community. The US Covid Atlas report builder allows you to do just that by creating an easy to read and customizable snapshot of COVID data. To get started, go to[ uscovidatlas.org](http://uscovidatlas.org/) and navigate to the map page. 

On the left side of the page, the icon dock contains a variety of tools available for use. Click the “Report Builder” button to begin

### Report Templates

Select one of the 4 default templates currently available showcase:

* **County statistics,** the most detailed data available on the Atlas
* **A country-wide snapshot,** for an overview of the whole nation
* **County statistics** **relative** to the whole country
* **A regional view** of how your county and its neighbors are doing

If none of these sound like what you are looking for, you can click **“Something Else (Blank)”**to start with a blank page to build on.

Next, choose from the available settings for your template, such as choosing your county, data, and naming your report.

* **_Charts_** - Line charts to show historic context and scatter charts to illustrate relationships of different variables

You can add more pages to your report by click the **_Add New Page_** button below the first page.
