# Getting Started: Atlas 101

## Map Orientation

Start exploring the Atlas by navigating to theuscovidatlas.org/map. After a few seconds, the main map will load. If you are returning to the Atlas and new data or features are available, you will see an option on the bottom right side of the map to reload. 

- The Main Map is shown at the center of the screen and takes up the majority of the view. A Map Legend can be found at the bottom of the screen, and the Map Control panel allowing you to zoom in, out, and more is at the left side. 
- At the far left side of the screen, you will see the Map Navigation panel. Data Sources & Map Variables is selected as the default, presented as a left sidebar.
At the top of the screen, you’ll find the Time Slider & Calendar panel, used to select time.
- At the right side of the screen, you’ll see the Cases floating panel, which you can move. This shows a graph of cases over time, with multiple options for viewing in-depth.
Once you click on the map, a scrollable right sidebar appears. - This Community Data panel provides more contextual information of the county clicked on within the main map.
- At the top of the screen, you’ll find the main Site Navigation panel.
