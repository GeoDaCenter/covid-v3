# Scale

<Grid container spacing={8}>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={10}>

    You can select different spatial scales (ex. county or state) and temporal scales (ex. daily, weekly, or cumulative COVID-19 cases) in the US Covid Atlas. Selecting different scales will provide different views of the pandemic. We encourage you to explore!

### Spatial Scales
<br />

LOCATION:  **<Icon symbol="settings" />  LEFT SIDEBAR**: Data & Variables
<Grid container spacing={8}>
    <Grid item xs={12} md={10}>
    The Atlas allows you to explore data at a county or state-specific level for each variable.  To change the spatial scale of your variable of interest, use the **Map Variables** panel to select the data source and variable that you would like to map, click on **Geography**, and choose *State* or *County*.

    Maps can miscommunicate underlying trends if health data are not appropriately normalized or classified, or communicated at the appropriate temporal or spatial scale (ex. daily versus 7-day average; county versus state level). Spatial literacy skills are crucial to avoid developing maps prone to misinterpretation, as well as avoid misinterpreting maps of Pandemic public health data.

### Temporal (Time) Scales

    LOCATION:  **<Icon symbol="settings" />  LEFT SIDEBAR**: Data & Variables

    The Atlas offers the option to explore data across various time scales, otherwise known as temporal scales, for each variable. To adjust the scale of data displayed on the Atlas, use the map variables panel (left sidebar) to select the data source/variable that you would like to map and click on the **Date Range** drop-down menu.  Choose between presenting cumulative, 7-day average, or daily new data. Selecting “Custom Range” allows you to incorporate data from a specific window of time that is selected using the *Time Slider & Calendar*. The following temporal scales are available on the US Covid Atlas:
    - **Cumulative**: Total number of instances, such as confirmed cases, deaths, or vaccines, since the start of the pandemic or the start of data collected. 
    - **Daily New**: The number of new instances per day for which data is available.
    - **7-Day Average**: The average number of instances over the previous 7-day period for which data is available.
    - **Custom Range**: Use the Time Slider and Calendar to choose a custom date range; i.e. the last month, 6 months, the latest variant, etc.

# Create a Thematic Map

<br />

<Grid container spacing={8}>

    <Grid item xs={12} md={7}>

    The **Map Type** buttons in the Atlas’ map variables panel allow you to change how the map is colored and how the data is visualized. This type of map is called a *thematic* or *choropleth* map. Each type of map will give you a new of the data.

    Choose between visualizing your variable of interest as a **Natural Breaks Map** (below, left figure) or **Box Map** (below, right figure). 

    We select these options as the best method of viewing the distribution of data overall at any given time period.

    ### Natural Breaks Map
    <br />
    Selecting Natural Breaks, also known as Jenks, will plot data from the selected variable according to a non-linear algorithm that categorizes observations into similar values, grouping and highlighting extreme observations. 

    It's like a clustering algorithm for the data, searching for optimal break points in the data. [Learn more](uscovidatlas.org/methods) about how the Jenks break works.

    <Grid item xs={12} md={5}>
    ### Box Map
    <br />
    Selecting Box Map will plot the selected variable by categorizing data into bins according to where it would lie on a box plot chart (25th, 50th, 75th percentile, etc.) This is useful for identifying outlier data -- data that is significantly different from the rest, i.e. counties with much higher or lower rates compared to all other counties. 

    This is the mapped version of a [traditional box plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Box_plot).

<HintBox>
    Alternate methods of determining data classification breaks for thematic maps include quantile, percentile, equal interval, or developing customized breaks for the data. While these are all useful approaches, they may not be optimal for all data.

    The US Covid Atlas uses standards of exploratory spatial data analysis to guide these decisions. If you'd like to explore more options, consider [downloading the data](uscovidatlas.org/download) and developing more maps yourself using free statistical software like [GeoDa](https://geodacenter.github.io/) and a [basic mapping tutorial](https://geodacenter.github.io/workbook/3a_mapping/lab3a.html).
